*You can jump to the main points at the end of the post* ‚è¨<br />
<br />
Launching ideas quickly doesn't work unless you're very lucky. Otherwise you simply will not be able to look at things objectively, you will not devote enough energy to a new product. When creating a product you have to take a leap of faith, not in the sense that you will lose everything but in the fact that you have to devote all of yourself. Of course the idea should be validated but even at the stage of validation the founder should treat the project as a long-term project and not as a one-night stand because persistence in process of validation will depend on this. Writing a couple of posts is not validation, inspired reviews about MVP are not signups yet, signups in your mailbox are not purchases yet, purchases do not mean that there will be no refunds and it's gonna be sustainable üôÇ<br />
<br />
It turns out that you need to believe very strongly in the idea at some inner level, to have the anticipation that it will work even before testing this hypothesis. But where does this feeling come from - from our experience, expertise, the surrounding information space, the people we read and listen to. All this gives rise to ideas in us and a quick subconscious analysis of these ideas. Based on this, we can say that finding a working idea by people who have experience behind them, have already created something outstanding and surrounded by the right people is not just luck.<br />
<br />
In the flow of my reasoning, I came to the conclusion that if you have experience in launching successful products, you can quite rely on a quick approach to validate ideas. The idea that you are going to test, you initially subconsciously evaluate as potentially successful, you believe in it from the very beginning. The rest of your long list of ideas is just brainstorming. You are completely involved in testing this idea, there is nothing else around for you, this is a number one idea. Due to your experience and subconscious analysis, this idea is likely to work. Or no, but then the next one is definitely yes.<br />
<br />
So, in order not to get confused in the confusion of my thoughts, I will highlight the main points:<br />
<br />
- Quick launch of projects will work if you get lucky<br />
- Long haul will more accurately determine the potential of the project<br />
- You need to treat each launch as a long-playing one, the hypothesis testing depends on it<br />
- Initially you need to believe very strongly in the idea in order for it to become long-lasting<br />
- Experience and expertise are needed to immediately believe in an idea<br />
- Quick launch of projects will work if something has already worked for you
